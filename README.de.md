### Which key where setted can you see on pictures below

+ Normally to switch between or in language list which you already installed use the key combination "Shift + Alt" on the left side of your keyboard.
+ Remember in every application where you want use a different language you should switch the language every time.
+ Maybe you should print the picture with the keyboard layout to check which keys where to find. Because the old or the standard layout of microsoft made just very poor. Maybe it was a person who never learned a foreign language and studied nothing. Yes, it is Microsoft!
